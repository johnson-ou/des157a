            <h2>Conceptual Changes</h2>
            <p> With my seperate ideas of centering my project around collectibles I own, Smiskis, and pictures of my favorite and most commonly visited places around Davis, I decided to compromise by combining the two ideas and have a "My day in the life as a Smiski". With their actionable poses, I believe I could find locations and visually interesting poses to create somewhat of a personal story.

            <h2>Interaction Changes</h2>
            <p> While I initially thought about using the mouse scroll for users to move from one Smiski to another, a hovering effect would be more intuitive for users to put their mouse over for the overlay to appear. This way, it would also allow for users to quickly navigate back and forth from one Smiski to another. Another key change is how I'm aiming to keep the mouse hotspot on the Smiski rather than changing it to the overlay (so the overlay would disappear if the mouse hovers off the Smiski rather than the image overlay).
