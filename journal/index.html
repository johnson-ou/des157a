            <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
            <p class="date">February 11, 2025</p>
            <p> The use of images in teaching and learning is a powerful way to engage critical thinking and close observation. The article "<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/" target="_blank">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a>" highlights how images can prompt deeper analysis, storytelling, and discussion. Visual thinking encourages us to look beyond the obvious, identifying patterns, emotions, and contexts that might otherwise be overlooked.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of a website that effectively utilizes visual thinking is Sintesis Studio. This site combines bold typography, motion effects, and layered animations to create an engaging and immersive experience. The use of fluid transitions and dynamic layouts forces visitors to process information visually rather than relying solely on text. A major strength of this design is its ability to guide the user's attention and create a sense of depth and movement, making the content more interactive and engaging. However, a potential drawback is that the heavy use of motion graphics might be overwhelming or distracting for some users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, innovative web design can enhance visual thinking by making information more dynamic and interactive. As compelling photographs can encourage close reading, well-designed digital experiences can inspire new ways of seeing and understanding perspectives.

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h2>
            <p class="date">January 30, 2025</p>
            <p>
                The article "<a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c" target="_blank">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>" highlighted the best uses in modals, overlays, and dialog windows. They are best used for important interactions like confirmations or  alerts, ensuring they provide clarity in their action. They should also be relevant to the specific context, appearing only in response to specific user actions, and returning to the previous state when closed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another interesting point is the emphasis on interaction best practices, including users to close modals using the Escape key or by clicking outside the modal, improving intuition. We learned and did an example of this in class, but it significantly helps it feel more natural with more options for the user. Additionally, modals should be designed responsively, adapting to different screen sizes without changing content.

            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <p class="date">January 20, 2025</p>
            <p>
                The article "<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank">Best Practices for Form Design</a>" highlighted the significance of best practices in user forms and was surprising to me in a variety of ways. Although we use it so intuitively in our daily lives, I didn't realize the importance that forms serve as a crucial point of interaction between users and digital products. A key takeaway from the article is the importance of minimizing cognitive load for readers by simplifying forms. As designers, achieving this while keeping it intuitive such grouping related fields, using clear labels, and implementing progressive disclosure ensures users are not overwhelmed by too much information at once.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another interesting point is the emphasis on error prevention and recovery. Real-time feedback to users, such as highlighting incomplete or incorrect fields as users fill out a form can prevent frustration and enhance task efficiency. Providing clear error messages instead of vague alerts ensures users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the article emphasises a strong point on how to properly use placeholder text. Although the text in a placeholder can guide users to input correct data and improve form completion, user testing shows that placeholder texts often hurt usability rather than helping it. As users type in the field the hint disappears and if users forget the hint, they need to clear the text to see it again. An alternative is to place the hints outside of the input box, so users can refer back to it at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
                A website form that exemplifies these best practices is <a href="https://airtable.com/appXKK1yjBFCjYzvM/pagyABExlUh6fdxfW/form" target="_blank">Airtable's Form</a>. Aggiework's recruitment form on Airtable demonstrates clarity through its simple layout, clear colored labels, and smooth validation process. The form is intuitive to navigate and accessible, providing a great user experience.
